I interpreted embedded as SMALL embedded (like: micro-controller, definitely not Linux, probably no RTOS)

“Where do you see the strength of C++/Rust with respect to embedded?”

C++: established, appeals to professionals and industry, track record for backwards compatibility
Rust: fresh start, borrow checker!, appeals to hobbyist (which are often just professionals in their spare time), agile 

“Where do you see potential for improvement in C++/Rust with respect to embedded?”
“What would you wish for in the next year/for the next release of C++/Rust to improve the situation?”

C++: a body of best practices / books / curricula suited to embedded
Rust: stability, professional (corporate) backing, also a body of knowledge!

Seriously: IMO one of the worst things that happened to C++ in the last 10 years was the retirement of Scott Meyers.

Note: I never mentioned the languages themselves!

“Into which of the 4 categories shown by Wouter would the Rust approach fall? What is it closest too?”

“Is is possible to embed Rust in an existing C++ Project? When does that make sense? And vice versa?”

I have no experience with this. 
Of course there is always the case "I want to program in X but I have this library in Y"

“Are there success stories that involve C++ and Rust (hint hint firefox)”

You mean involve both languages? 
Sorry, not that I am aware of, but note that that means very little.

“Did you learn something new by participating in this cross pollination event?”

Preparing this talk involved more preparation (and involvment from the hosts) than any of the talks I did on conferences ;)

A gaze in my crystal ball. In 10 years from now:
- Rust has been superseded by Oxide, which is still changing to fast to be of widespread use.
- C++30 has incorporated every good feature of Rust, and just to be on the safe side, all the bad ones too. The GCC and Clang teams have merged, and hope to implement most of these features by 2040. The last person that was rumored to understand all of C++ died 5 years ago.
